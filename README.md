weasyl_thumb
============

Make a shortcut to weasyl_thumb.exe somewhere convenient. Drag-and-drop an image file onto it, and the program will make a 240x240 thumbnail in the same directory, called "thumb_[filename].png".

If the original image is not square, transparent space will be added either on the sides or on the top/bottom.
